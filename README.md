To run this repository from GitHub follow these steps:

### 1. **Clone the Repository:**

   - **Step 1:** Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - **Step 2:** Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository using the `cd` command.
   - **Step 3:** Use the `git clone` command to clone the repository. Replace `your-repository-url` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-url.git
   ```

### 2. **Open the Repository in VS Code:**

   - **Step 1:** After cloning, navigate to the cloned repository folder using the terminal.

   ```bash
   cd your-repository-folder
   ```

   - **Step 2:** Open the folder in VS Code by typing:

   ```bash
   code .
   ```

   This command will open the current directory in VS Code.

### 3. **Run the HTML File:**

   - **Step 1:** In VS Code, locate your HTML file in the Explorer panel on the left.
   - **Step 2:** Right-click on the HTML file and select **"Open with Live Server"**. This option requires the Live Server extension, which can be installed from the VS Code Marketplace.
   - **Step 3:** If you don't have the Live Server extension installed, you can open the HTML file directly in your browser by double-clicking on it in your file explorer.

### 4. **View the Website:**

   - After opening the HTML file with Live Server, a new browser tab will open with your website running locally. If you're not using Live Server, just open the HTML file directly in your browser.

### 5. **Make Changes and See Updates:**

   - As you make changes to your HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files in VS Code, you can save them, and the browser will automatically reload (if using Live Server) to reflect your changes.
